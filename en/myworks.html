    <p>Just a simple application of the chip MT8880 to dial the phone automatically, part of a home security system that calls you when intending to warn you of the danger.</p>
    <p> -- I'm still working on the introduction documentation. COMING SOON! --</p>

    <h1>Words Filling</h1>
    <p>This is a script that I have done in Python to ease some manual work to fill words in a picture. See on <a href="https://github.com/wild-flame/Words_Filling">github</a> for more info. </p>

    <h1>Websites</h1>
    <p>I'm a learner of Ruby on Rails and worked on my spare time for a company named <a href="http://www.yankeji.cn">Yankeji</a> to develop their website. (It's simple still^^, but almost on my own). You can see it through the link <a href="http://www.yankeji.cn">http://www.yankeji.cn</a></p>
