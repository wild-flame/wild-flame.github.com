# Use MT8880 to Auto dial a phone

## Introduction

This is just a basic implementaion using the MT8880 chip to dial a phone on a MCU, it is part of the home security system based on ZIGBEE. I'm only in charge of the dialing module.

## MT8880

The MT8880 is a dual-tone, multi-frequency (DTMF) transceiver on a
chip. It can be configured to send or receive “touch” tones used in many phone and radio communication systems.

This is the MT8880 chip that I use.

I implement this using C language to dial my phone.
